To install, paste the following in a empty file:

(let ((buffer (url-retrieve-synchronously
               "http://tromey.com/elpa/package-install.el")))
  (save-excursion
    (set-buffer buffer)
    (goto-char (point-min))
    (re-search-forward "^$" nil 'move)
    (eval-region (point) (point-max))
    (kill-buffer (current-buffer))))

then call eval-buffer.

That will download the file and place it at ~/.emacs.d/elpa/package.el.

(very neat elisp trick! note to self: url-retrieve-synchronously is bundled with emacs 23. Use it like wget/curl!)

Also, it automatically adds the following in your .emacs file, so that it'll be loaded everytime you start emacs.

(when
    (load
     (expand-file-name "~/.emacs.d/elpa/package.el"))
  (package-initialize))
